		<p>Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and their authorized agents to do the same. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) of 1998, the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office <a target="_blank" href="https://www.copyright.gov">website</a>.</p>
		<h3>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h3>
		<p>Please note that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly misrepresent that the material or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.</p>
		<p>We may, at our discretion or as required by law, share a copy of your notification or counter-notification with third parties. This may include sharing the information with the account holder engaged in the allegedly infringing activity or for publication. If you are concerned about your information being forwarded, you may wish to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.copyrighted.com/professional-takedowns">hire an agent</a>to report infringing material for you.</p>
